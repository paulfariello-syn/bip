def visit_dfs_cnode(cnode, callback):
    """
        Basic visitor for a CNode: this will allow to call a callback on every
        node under the current one (and including the current node) in the
        AST. This method does not used the visitor from hexrays
        (``ctree_visitor_t``). The callback will receive a :class:`CNode` in
        argument.

        This visitor implements a Deep-First Search (DFS) algorithm which will
        always visit first the :class:`CNodeExpr` and then the
        :class:`CNodeStmt`. The callback is called before visiting deeper.
        For an object which inherit from :class:`CNodeExpr` the child nodes
        will be called in the same order than returned by
        :meth:`~CNodeExpr.ops`; for an object which inherit from
        :class:`CNodeStmt` the child nodes will be called in the same order
        than returned by :meth:`~CNodeStmt.expr_children` (expression) follow by
        the nodes in the same order as :meth:`~CNodeStmt.stmt_children`
        (statements).

        If the callback return ``False`` the visitor will stop. Every other
        result is ignore.

        .. note:: This function will not visit a statement which is under a
            :class:`CNodeExprInsn` . Those should not be present in the last
            stage of a ctree and so this should not be a problem.

        An exception raised by the callback will interupt the visitor.

        :param cnode: An object which inherit from :class:`CNode`. This object
            and all its child will be visited.
        :param callback: A callable taking one argument which will be called
            on all the :class:`CNode` visited with the :class:`CNode` as
            argument. If it returns False the visitor stops.
        :return: True if the visit got to the end, False if it was stopped
            by the ``callback``.
